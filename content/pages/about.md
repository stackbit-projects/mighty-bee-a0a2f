![A woman using a laptop](/images/about.jpg)

A family owned business based in Angmering, West Sussex.
We are committed to providing you with a top quality service repairing your vehicle to the highest standards.
Whatever your needs, be it small repairs from scuffs/ scratches and small dents to full resprays, we are here to help.

## Credentials

I have a BA in English Literature and an MBA in Marketing from the University of California. I am also a certified campaign manager in all the major PPC platforms, and a staff writer in several industry publications.

My 20 years of experience have taught me to effectively identify the audience for which I write, and explain complex concepts in a friendly and non-intimidating way.



## Writing for Action

I believe that each and every piece of writing should inspire an action that is connected to a tangible business goal. I will work with you to define our content KPIs, understand how to properly track and measure them, and hit our goals by creating effective messaging across all of your digital assets.
